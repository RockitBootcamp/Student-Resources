###Extra Study

#### `while` loops
- `While` loops allows you to execute a block of code while a certain condition exists. 
```php
$i = 0;
while ($i <= 10){
  echo $i++, "<br>";
}
```
The above loops through until $i is no longer less than or equal to 10 and will print the numbers 1 through 10.
```php
$items = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish', 'horse', 'bird'];
$i = 0;

while ($i < count($items)){
  echo $a = $items[$i], "<br>";
  $i++;
}
```
The above will loop through the array as long as $i is less than the length of the array. It will print each item listed in the array. 

#### `for` loops
- `for` loops allow you to execute a block of code a specified number of times.
- The syntax in a `for` loop includes three expressions separated by semicolons.
  - First expression is the initialization
  - Second expression is the condition
  - Third expression is the increment or modification
The first expression initializes the value at the beginning of the loop. The second expression tests the condition each time around the loop, and finally the modification (third) expression is executed at the end of each iteration.
```php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    echo $i, "<br>";
}
```
The above initialized the value of $i to 1, loops through testing the condition for each iteration that $i is less than or equal to 10, and modifies and prints out the numbers 1 through 10.  
```php
$a = 0;
$b = 0;

for( $i=0; $i<5; $i++ ){
    $a += 10;
    $b += 5;
}
echo ("At the end of the loop a=$a and b=$b" );
```
The above will iterate through 5 times and modify the assigned value of two variables with each loop through. So, 
- the first iteration $a is 10 and $b is 5; 
- the second iteration $a is 20 and $b is 10; 
- the third iteration $a is 30 and $b is 15; 
- the fourth iteration $a is 40 and $b is 20; 
- and finally, the fifth iteration $a is 50 and $b is 25. 

So, the result is a sentence that reads: At the end of the loop a=50 and b=25.  
#### `foreach` loops
`foreach` loops are used to iterate through arrays and objects and there are two syntaxes
```php
$array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

foreach ($array as $value){
  execute some code;
}

//or it can be written with the $key and $value as follows:

$array = [
   'a' => 'donut',
   'b' => 'coffee',
   'c' => 'soda',
   'd' => 'cereal'
];

foreach ($array as $key => $value){
  execute some code;
}
```
The internal array pointer automatically points to the first element when the `foreach` loop begins, then moves to the next element with each iteration. 

The syntax of the `foreach` includes the name of your array ($array), then after 'as' you can have simply the value of the array ($value) or the `$key => $value` pair
#####example 1:
```php
$animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish', 'horse', 'bird'];

foreach ($animals as $animal){
  echo "I would like to have a $animal.", "<br>";
}
```
The result of the above code will be:
```ssh
I would like to have a dog.
I would like to have a cat.
I would like to have a fish.
I would like to have a horse.
I would like to have a bird.
```
#####example 2:
```php
$team = [
	'name' => 'The Suns',
	'num_player' => 7,
	'primary_color' => 'orange',
	'record' => '5-20',
	'last_championship' => 'never'
];

foreach($team as $property => $value) {
	echo "idx: $property, value: $value<br>";
}
```
The above result will be: 
```ssh
idx: name, value: The Suns
idx: num_player, value: 7
idx: primary_color, value: orange
idx: record, value: 5-20
idx: last_championship, value: never
```
#####example 3:
create a dropdown that allows you to select from a list of states
```php
<?php
$states = ['Alabama', 'Alaska', 'Arizona', 'Arkansas', 'California', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut'];
$states_opts = '';

foreach($states as $state) {
    $state_opts .= "<option>$state</option>\n";
}
?>

 <select name="" id="">
    <?php echo $state_opts; ?>
 </select>
 ```
######example 4:

create a drop down with a list of products and a "buy it now" button, and set the option to the value of the last item selected.
#######Step 1: Create your products list
```php
<?php 
$products = [
	'7897wej2' => 'desk',,
	'2342314asdf' => 'chair',
	'23314sdf' => 'boat',
	'734253eah' => 'car'
];
```
#######Step 2: create options
```php
$opts = '';
foreach($products as $key => $product){
    $opts .= "<option value=\"$key\">$product</option>";
}

?>
```

#######Step 3: add the html and put options in a select tag & test it 
#######Step 4: finish the form (action is blank because we're submitting back to ourselves, method is GET. We will get the values from the GET array)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>php loops</title>
</head>
<body>

Pick a product:
<form action="">
   <select name="product_id" id="">
	 <?php echo $opts; ?>
   </select>
   <button>Buy it NOW</button>
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
#######Step 5: handle the form submission by:
########5a: check to see if anything (product_id) is there. This will go right below your products list and above your code from step 2.
```php
if(isset($_GET['product_id'])){
}
```
#######5b: set the product_id to a variable with an empty string, then set it to the input we get within the if-statement.
```php
$product_id = '';

if(isset($_GET['product_id'])){
   $product_id = $_GET['product_id'];
}
```
#######5c: create a message that also outputs the product name selected.
```php
if(isset($_GET['product_id'])){
   $product_id = $_GET['product_id'];
   $msg = "You bought a {$products[$product_id]}";
}
```
#######5d: put the message within html (below or above the form tags)
```html
<?php echo $msg ?>
```
#######Finally, the code put all together should look like this:
```php
<?php 
$products = [
    '7897wej2' => 'desk',
    '2342314asdf' => 'chair',
    '23314sdf' => 'boat',
    '734253eah' => 'car'
];

$product_id = '';

if(isset($_GET['product_id'])){
	$product_id = $_GET['product_id'];
	$msg = "You bought a {$products[$product_id]}";
}

$opts = '';
foreach($products as $key => $product){
	$opts .= "<option value=\"$key\">$product</option>";
}
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>php ex4</title>
</head>
<body>

Pick a product:
<form action="">
	<select name="product_id" id="">
		<?php echo $opts ?>
	</select>
	<button>Buy it NOW!</button>
</form>
	<br>
	<?php echo $msg ?>
</body>
</html>
```
