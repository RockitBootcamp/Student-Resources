# 5000 Cows

[See the solution](5000cows Solution.md), only after you've tried


## Easy Level

1. Start by making a very simple `Cow` class with only a constructor and `$name` property.
1. Make a loop that iterates 5000 times and with each iteration makes a `new Cow()`.
 - For now, each cow will have the same name
 - You'll need to figure out a way to store the 5000 cows so you have one variable with all the cows inside it

## Medium Level

1. Make an array of Cow names. With each iteration of making cows, choose a random cow name from the list so we don't have the same name for each cow
1. How do we figure out what is the name for Cow 300?

## Difficult Level

1. Make a `Farmer` class with a `$name` property.
1. Make several instances of farmers. For instance, `$john = new Farmer('John');`
1. Add a `milkCow($cow)` method to the `Farmer` class. When this method is called, `$john->milkCow($cow)`, you will pass one `$cow` object into the method. Inside the method, you should output the message "Farmer John milked ____ the cow!", only replace the underscore with the actual cow's name
1. Iterate (loop) over a certain subsection of your array of cows. With each iteration, have a farmer object milk the cow from the array.
