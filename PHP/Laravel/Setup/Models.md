## Model Class

Models are objects that represent your data in the database. More specifically, a model maps to a table. With models, you won't have to perform basic database operations on your table by writing SQL. Instead, the model will perform these operations for you. When you instantiate a model object, the object will represent exactly one row from the model's table.

To make a model, create a class that extends the base `Model` class:

```php
namespace App\Models;

class User extends Model {
	protected static $table = 'user';
	protected static $key = 'user_id';
}
```

Be sure to namespace your model to `App\Models`.

Technically, this is a complete model. All you need to do is extend the `Model` class and provide properties for the table name and the primary key. If your table simply uses "id" as its primary key, then you won't need to make a `$key` property at all because "id" is the default value for `$key`. This example assumes we have a primary key called "user_id".

Again, this is a complete model, but if you plan to add your own methods to enhance the model more, and you plan to use the Database or SQL classes in those methods, then be sure to `use` the database and SQl class:

```php
use DB;
use App\Library\Sql;
```

### Instantiate

To use this model, simply instantiate an object by passing the user's ID into the constructor:

```php
$user = new User(21);
```

Doing this will automatically grab user 21's information and populate the model with it.


### Getting

You can access model data as follows:

```php
$user = new User(21);
echo $user->first_name; // Outputs: William
echo $user->last_name;  // Outputs: Clinton
```

> Assuming your user table has `first_name` and `last_name` fields

If you want to get the entire model as an array, call `getData()`:

```php
$user = new User(21);
print_r($user->getData());
```

Or as an alternative, you can simply treat the model as if it's a string:

```php
echo $user;
```

> This will return a string in a similar format to `print_r()`. This is probably only useful for debugging.

### Inserting

While you could write your own insert logic on your own (using `Sql::insert()` from above), models make this super convenient. Start by making an empty model (one where you don't pass an ID into), and then set the properties of your model as follows:

```php
$user = new User(); // Note it's an empty model since we didn't pass a number in

$user->first_name  = 'William';
$user->last_name   = 'Clinton';
$user->email       = 'honestguy@yahoo.com';
$user->password    = 'monicalove';

$user_id = $user->save();
```

When you're done setting the properties, you can call the `save()` method as seen above to save the model to the database. The `save()` method will return to you the newly created user ID.

Or, if you prefer, you can pass an array of data directly into the model's `insert()` method. 

```php
$user = new User();

$data = [
		'first_name' => 'William',
		'last_name' => 'Clinton',
		'email' => 'honestguy@yahoo.com',
		'password' => 'monicalove',
		'datetime_added' => 'NOW()'
	];

$user_id = $user->insert($data, ['datetime_added']);
```
Technically, the `save()` method from the previous example is just a wrapper method that calls `insert()`. You can choose either method `save()` or `insert()`, however only the `insert()` method lets you pass in the "ignore keys" array similar to calling `Sql:insert()`.

### Updating

Calling the `save()` method in the example above performed an `INSERT` because the model was empty. Let's make a model that isn't empty (user: 21) and do a similar `save()` call:

```php
$user = new User(21);
$user->first_name = 'Bill';
$user->password = 'sorryhillary';
$user->save();
```

If the model isn't empty, the `save()` method will perform an `UPDATE` instead of an `INSERT`. We can also do an `UPDATE` by calling the model's `update()` method directly. The following code does the same update but by calling `update()`:

```php
$user = new User(1);

$data = [
	'first_name'  => 'Bill',
	'password'    => 'sorryhillary'
];

$user->update($data);
```

## Collection Class

Models are great but they only operate on one record at a time. It's easy to get that record by calling the model:

```
$user = new User(21);
```

But what if you wanted several records? Or what if you wanted all the records from a table? Does that mean you'll have to make individual calls to `new User()` for each one? Well you could, but that would be inefficient because each time you call `new User()` you're performing a database call.

Here's an examle. Let's say we wanted to get all the users in our system:

```php
$results = DB::select("SELECT * FROM user");

$users = [];
foreach ($results AS $row) {
	$users[] = new User($row['user_id']);
}
```

If our goal was to get an array of users, this code technically works. But if we had 50 users in our system, this logic would do 51 SQL calls. 1 for selecting all users, and 50 more for each call to `new User()`.

This is where collections come in. A collection is simply a list of models. In our case, a collection will be an object that holds a list of models. Here's how you get a collection:

```php
$users = User::all();
```

This one line of code just did everything that our previous example did, but it did it with 1 SQL call instead of 51. The only other difference is the previous example makes `$users` as an array. This example, however, makes `$users` as an object. 

Also notice that we are calling the `all()` method statically.

If you wanted to access a specific user in our collection, you can do so by calling the `get()` method of the collection:

```php
$users = User::all();
echo $users->get(21)->first_name; // Outputs: William
```

Or if you want to loop over your collection you can call `getArray()` to get the array of models extracted out of the collection object:

```php
$users = User::all();
foreach ($users->getArray() as $user) {
	echo $user->first_name;
}
```

This example will output each user's name. Note that the `$user` object at this point is exactly the same thing that you would get from calling `new User()`;

If you want to narrow down how many models are in your collection, you can do so as follows:

```php
$bobs = User::all(['first_name' => 'bob']);
```

This collection (now called "bobs") will only hold models that have a `first_name` of "bob". So as you can see, you can pass an array into the `all()` method whereby the keys are fields and the values are the database values. This actually produces a similar SQL statement to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM `user` WHERE `first_name` = 'bob';
```

You can add as many conditions as you want:

```php
$items = Item::all(['invoice_id' => 10, 'active' => 1]);
```

This example will get all "items" that have an `invoice_id` of 10 - in other words, it will grab all items that belong to invoice: 10 because `invoice_id` is a foreign key. Further, it will only grab items that are active. This is the SQL statement that the collection writes for you to get it's models:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `item`
WHERE `invoice_id` = 10
AND `active` = 1;
```

Happy coding!
