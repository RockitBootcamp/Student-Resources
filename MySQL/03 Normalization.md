# Lesson 3: Normalization

Identifier   | Objectives
-------------|------------
MySQL: 3.1   | Explain basic normalization concepts:
             | &bull; Eliminate duplicative columns from the same table.
             | &bull; Reduce Redundancies
             | &bull; Create separate tables for each group of related data and identify each row with a unique column or set of columns (the primary key).
             | &bull; Create relationships between these new tables and their predecessors through the use of foreign keys.
             | &bull; Don't store derived data such as "age"
MySQL: 3.2   | Explain Anomalies:
             | &bull; Insert Anomaly
             | &bull; Delete Anomaly
             | &bull; Update Anomaly
MySQL: 3.3   | Explain table partitioning (abstractions)
MySQL: 3.4   | Explain Composite Primary Keys
