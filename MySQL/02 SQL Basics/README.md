## Examples

### SELECT

`SELECT` statements are how you retrieve records from a database. A simple select statement might look like

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table
```

### INSERT

An `INSERT` statement allows you to create new rows in a table. Here's an example of a simple `INSERT`

```sql
INSERT INTO my_table (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Bruce', 'Wayne')
```

### UPDATE

An `UPDATE` statement allows you to modify fields in a record, as seen below.

```sql
UPDATE my_table SET first_name = "John" WHERE last_name = "Wayne"
```

### DELETE

`DELETE` statements allow you to remove a row from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM my_table WHERE last_name = "Wayne"
```

## Pre Study

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is generally used to query, or "ask" the database a question and to get a response. For instance, you can query the database for "Give me all the users in the database". Written as SQL this would look like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user;
```

This is called a "SELECT" statement. It's used to get information out of the database. Other statements include:

- `CREATE TABLE`: To create a new database table
- `INSERT`: To insert row(s) into a database table
- `UPDATE`: to update row(s) of a database table
- `DELETE`: to delete row(s) of a database table

First, let's break down the simple `SELECT` statement from above. In it's most simple form, you can select a mere function like this:

```sql
SELECT NOW();
```

> Output: 2015-02-07 12:25:36

Doing `SELECT` is just saying "I want results back". The `NOW()` function gets the database's current time. Similarly, you can do:

```sql
SELECT PASSWORD('abc123');
```

> Output: *6691484EA6B50DDDE1926A220DA01FA9E575C18A

This is MySQL's way of encrypting "abc123" so we can safely store it in the database.

Doing selects like this is cool for learning, but not necessarily practical real contexts. Typically when we want to select something, it comes from a table. Selecting from a table requires us to say what data we want back and what table we want it from:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user;
```

The `*` astersik in this case is a wildcard that says "Select all the fields". Then notice the `FROM` keyword followed by the table name `user`. So in a sense, a basic select statement looks like this:

SELECT [what] FROM [where]

While it's not required, generally developers type SQL keywords in all caps. In contrast, we generally use all lowercase (with hyphens for spaces) for table and column names. This makes it easier to read SQL statements:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM user;
```

In this case, we're not using the wildcard for what we want back, but rather specifying column names with commas between them. Note that these column names must be in the user table or this will cause errors.

### Beautify

Sometimes `SELECT` statements can get long with regards to what columns are being selected. It's very common to put the `FROM` clause on its own line to "beautify" the statement

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, password, date_added, age
FROM user;
```

Another way to do it is like this:

```sql
SELECT
	id,
	name,
	email,
	password,
	date_added,
	age
FROM user;
```

### Reserved words

Like many languages, SQL has reserved words. "Select", for instance, is one of them. If you use a reserved word as a table name or column name, you might get into trouble. You can use reserved words as long as you put single back ticks around them:

```sql
SELECT `count` FROM `select`
```

This is a silly example but it illustrates our point. If you want to have a table called "select" and a column called "count" (which is also a reserved word), you would have to use back ticks or you'll confuse the SQL parser. Some companies might encourage always using back ticks no matter what, but many are okay with using them only if necessary. 

### `WHERE`

By default, `SELECT` wants to grab as much information as possible. If you do `SELECT * FROM USER`, you can expect to get every record from the user table even if there are millions. The `WHERE` clause allows us to reduce the amount of data we want back by asking for more specific data. For instance:

```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM user
WHERE id = 1
```

Lets assume the above SQL statement was ran against this table:

id | name | email | password | date_added
---|------|-------|----------|----------
1|brad|brad@aol.com|cssguy|2015-01-11
2|daniel|daniel@msn.com|thegreathunter!|2015-01-19
3|kris|kris@yahoo.com|14.1rocks|2015-01-21

This says "Select all information about users where the user table's id column is 1". Note that the `name`, `email`, and `id` columns in this statement are all from the user table. The `WHERE` clause reduces the number of results we get back by saying we only want records that match the criteria given in the `WHERE` clause

This is the "result" of the above SQL statement:

name | email
-----|------
brad |brad@aol.com

The `user` table has many more columns and rows, but we're only asking for `name` and `email` column of the row that has an `id` of `1`.

The "result" looks like a table right? It's actually not a table but rather a temporary result set. Think of it as an in-memory, temporary, representation of your SQL statement. So how do you use it? We'll talk about how to connect to the database in another guide, but just to quench your thirst for knowledge, imagine that we'll be able to convert this result set into an associative array. So imagine the array your given will be like this in PHP:

```php
echo $row['name'];  // output's brad
echo $row['email']; // output's brad@aol.com
```

> Where in this case, `$row` is the associative array that holds our SQL results

#### `WHERE ... AND ...`

If we need to reduce the number of results we want based on two criteria, then we need to add `AND` to the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM user
WHERE id > 2
AND name = 'brad'
```

There are a few things going on here:

1. Notice that we put the `AND` part on its own line. That's good for beautification
1. Notice that we can use `>` operators similar to most programming languages.
1. Notice that in SQL, we only use one equal sign to do a comparison operator, which is different from the common `==` you would see in most programming languages.
1. And lastly, notice that because 'brad' is a string of text, it must be in quotes.

Also, did you notice that this SQL statement matches no records from our table? There are rows where `id` is bigger than `2`, and there are rows where `name` is `brad`, but there are no rows where both of these conditions are met at the same time. It is possible for your SQL statement to produce no results as in this case. Sometimes that's okay.
