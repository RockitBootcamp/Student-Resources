## Steps to make a Virtual Host

1) Create a new VirtualHost file. These are located at `/Users/[username]/Hosts`. It's easiest to go here in Finder (on Mac) or similar window program and copy one that already exists to make a new one. The name of the file should be your project name then with `.conf` as the extension.

The file should resemble:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/Users/[username]/Sites/[projectname]"
    ServerName "mac.[projectname].com"
</VirtualHost>
```

> Note that the value for `ServerName` resembles what you'll be typing in the URL. The `DocumentRoot` value is where you want Apache to go when the URL is typed.

2) Restart Apache. Editing or adding a VirtualHost file will require an Apache restart
 - type: `sudo apachectl restart`

3) Edit your "hosts" file, not to be confused with Virutal Hosts. Edit the hosts file at `/etc/hosts`. Add a DNS record to point our fake domain name to the local IP address which is always `127.0.0.1`

```
127.0.0.1    mac.[projectname].com
```

> Editing this file does not require an Apache restart

4) Last but not least, make sure you actually make a folder in your sites folder: `/Users/[username]/Sites/[projectname]`, probably with an index file or something to look at in the browser.
