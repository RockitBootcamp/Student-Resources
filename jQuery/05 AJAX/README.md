## Pre Study

### AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It's actually an outdated term, but still in common use, so it's good to know. The updated acronym is XHR (XML HTTP Request). 

### JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's used to share data between machines (i.e. client and servers). An example of JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "batman",
  "firstName": "Bruce",
  "lastName": "Wayne"
}
```
