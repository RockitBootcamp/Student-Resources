Practice Carwash
You are a carwash attendant with a bucket of soap and need to wash all the dirty cars while keeping 
track of how much soap you have left. 
Create a Vehicle class that has properties `size` and `isDirty`. 
Create an Attendant class.
Add a getSoapAmount method to `Attendant` that returns how much soap is left.
Add a wash method to `Attendant` that takes a vehicle that is dirty, wash it, and decrease your
soap amount based on vehicle size(10%).
Change `isDirty` to clean if washed.
```
