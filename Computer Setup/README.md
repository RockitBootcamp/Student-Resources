# Computer Setup

## OS

Students should have a recent version of Ubuntu (or similar Linux OS like Mint) or OS X. These instructions will serve as a guide and checklist of the tasks that need to be complete

### Ubuntu

- Install Ubuntu
- [Install LAMP](Ubuntu-14.04 LAMP.md)

### OS X
- [Install MySQL](OS X Install MySQL.md)
- [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

## Apache and Virtual Host Setup

You'll need to know basic Unix commands for these steps. Here is a little legend of common commands you'll need:

- `whoami`: See what your username is
- `pwd`: "Print Working Directory" - see what folder you're in
- `sudo`: Type this before other commands to have a higher level of permissions
- `sudo apachectl restart`
