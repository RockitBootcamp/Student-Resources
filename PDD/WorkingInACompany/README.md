- Who they reported to
- Who reported to them
- Who their colleagues/co-workers were
- Whether they worked on a team or in a department with people with different/complementary roles and tasks 
- Relationship with clients (who was the client, internal or external?)

### Various Company Structures (Analysis)

Refer to **Slides: Company Structures** (from the <a href="RockIT PPD2. Working in a Company as a Web-Developer.pptx">Working in a company as a web-developer Powerpoint Presentation</a>), describe  the different company structures  illustrating:

- Hierarchical structures
- Flat-structures

- The position of a Web-developer situated in a team in a small dev-shop

Talk through the structures and the reporting lines.
Give each student a copy of **Slides: Company Structures** (from the presentation <a href="RockIT PPD2. Working in a Company as a Web-Developer.pptx">Working in a company as a web-developer</a>)

Refer students to **Slide: Company Structures and the Developer’s Role**

Ask students to work in pairs or small groups to think about what the similarities and differences are in the role of a web-developer in the different structures/environments.

In considering the question “What’s the difference in the role of  a Line Manager and a Project Manager?”, make sure the following are reviewed:

A Project Manager:
- Directing and influencing what people do, but has no stake in their livelihood
- Doesn’t have a hand in the code or QA
- Brings people together to make it right
- Getting people to understand what the product is
- Make sure project is delivered on time, to budget, at the right quality
- Adjust the timeline, deal with the people asking for the actual task

What a PM Expects from Developers
- You need to interact as a developer to be part as the big picture
- You need to be a part of that team
- Never be afraid to speak up
- We need to have the best ideas, so speak up
- Don’t worry about making mistakes
- Needs to be able to get them to communicate in the right fashion
- Come with concerns or problems ASAP, don’t be a hero
- Get them to be a constructive team member
