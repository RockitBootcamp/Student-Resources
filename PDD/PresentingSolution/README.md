### Choose a Solution Exercise

What is the best shape for given these alternatives
<img src="shapes.jpg" alt="Shapes">

You are given the following requirements:

* The shape must have a square
* The shape must have a triangle
* The shape must have the color orange

| Shape | Has Square | Has Triangle  | Has Orange |
| ------| :----------: | :-------------: | :----------: |
| 1 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; | | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp;  |
| 2 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |  &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp;  | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp;  |
| 3 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |  | 
| 4 |  | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |   |
| 5 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |  |

### Outline

- **Problem:** One sentence explanation of the problem. 
- **Background:** Provide the context on why this is a problem. Lots of text, pictures, evidence.
- **Risks/Assumptions:** List all assumptions and risks that define the scope of the problem.
- **Edge Cases:** Consider all of the domain objects. Consider extreme attributes or interactions
- **Metrics:** Define what makes each solution different. If you have a gut feeling that one solution is correct, try to describe the metric that makes it feel correct. Different types of metrics: Common, industry, company, etc
- **Possible Solutions:** Brainstorm any solution. Do not discriminate at this stage
- **Analysis:** Iterative process. Choose best candidates and attempt to measure each metric.

## Effective Written Documents

- Basics (Adapt to your audience, )
- Process (Plan, Design, Draft, Format, Revise)

An effective abstract comprises four layers:

1. Details
2. Me (What I did)
3. You (Why you should be interested etc)
4. Context

## Effective Presentations

- Slides
- Presenting

### Slides
- Prefer Graphics over Text
- See [Slide Template](TM&Th-3.2-template.pdf)
- See [Slide Checklist](TM&Th-3.3-checklist.pdf)

### Presenting
- Tell a story
- Breathe
- Drink
- Dress nice
- Record Yourself and watch it. (Ugh)
- Consider Public Speaking Meetup
- See [Speaking Hacks](http://www.speakinghacks.com/)
- See [Rehersal Tips](Rehersal.txt)

## Effective Visualization

- Types of Data
- Basic Charts
- Charts vs Graphics
- Telling a Story

### Types of Data

- Quantitative. Things you can measure (1 2 3)
- Ordered / Qualitative. Things that can be ordered (Low Med High)
- Categorical. Everything else (Fruit Vegetables)

See [Levels of Measurement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)

### Choosing a Graph
Choosing a graph depends on:
- Intended message (Comparison, Distribution, Correlation, Evolution)
- Type of Data 

### Telling a Story

1. Formulate the Question
2. Gather the data
3. Apply a visual representation

**Formulate the Question**
This can be an iterative process. You will learn how to ask a good question when you are familiar with the data.

**Apply a visual Representation**
See [TM&Th-4.0-summary.pdf](TM&Th-4.0-summary.pdf)

### Visualization vs Statistical Properties
- Four Datasets that have similar statistical properties but different visulization [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet)

## Activity
Keeping in mind the tips we just learned, we are now going to break into teams and analyze different types of presentations. Then you will give a presentation to the rest of the class on your findings.
- Look for:
	- What is the structure?
	- Is there an intro?
	- Are there transitions?
	- Does the audience know why they should care?
	- Does the audience need more?
	- etc.
- Discuss what effective presenters demonstrated
- Prepare a brief presentation to share with the class
	- Use the tips and best practices learned from this session for your own presentation
	- Set the context, have an intro/conclusion
	- Use effective visualization

- Break into teams and each team will be assigned a category to analyze.

######Categories
- Effective Writing
	- Analyze a Talk from [Commencement Speeches](http://apps.npr.org/commencement/) or [White House Remarks](http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-and-remarks)

- Effective Presentations
	- Analyze Ted Talk

- Effective Visualization
	- Choose a data set from [http://www.data.gov/](http://www.data.gov/)

## Conclusion
- This is only the tip of the iceburg. There are a lot of resources out there
- Assignment
	- What would you do different to have had a better presentation?
	- What area do you feel you are strong?
	- What area do you feel you are weak?
	- What information was most interesting?
