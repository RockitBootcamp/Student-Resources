- (15 min) Effective Presentations
- (15 min) Effective Visualization
- (45 min) Group Exercise
- (15 min) Wrap up

## Note to the Teacher: 

The student will present their final project at the end of the bootcamp. Presentation skills are importaint for sucess.

This lecture will cover:
* Defining the Problem
* Effective Written Documents

### Choose a Solution Exercise

What is the best shape for given these alternatives
<img src="shapes.jpg" alt="Shapes">

You are given the following requirements:

* The shape must have a square
* The shape must have a triangle
* The shape must have the color orange

| Shape | Has Square | Has Triangle  | Has Orange |
| ------| :----------: | :-------------: | :----------: |
| 1 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; | | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp;  |
| 2 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |  &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp;  | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp;  |
| 3 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |  | 
| 4 |  | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |   |
| 5 | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;√&nbsp;&nbsp; |  |

### Outline

- **Problem:** One sentence explanation of the problem. 
- **Background:** Provide the context on why this is a problem. Lots of text, pictures, evidence.
- **Risks/Assumptions:** List all assumptions and risks that define the scope of the problem.
- **Edge Cases:** Consider all of the domain objects. Consider extreme attributes or interactions
- **Metrics:** Define what makes each solution different. If you have a gut feeling that one solution is correct, try to describe the metric that makes it feel correct. Different types of metrics: Common, industry, company, etc
- **Possible Solutions:** Brainstorm any solution. Do not discriminate at this stage
- **Analysis:** Iterative process. Choose best candidates and attempt to measure each metric.

## Effective Written Documents

- Basics (Adapt to your audience, )
- Process (Plan, Design, Draft, Format, Revise)

An effective abstract comprises four layers:

1. Details
2. Me (What I did)
3. You (Why you should be interested etc)
4. Context

## Effective Presentations

- Slides
- Presenting

### Slides
- Prefer Graphics over Text
- See [Slide Template](TM&Th-3.2-template.pdf)
- See [Slide Checklist](TM&Th-3.3-checklist.pdf)

### Presenting
- Tell a story
- Breathe
- Drink
- Dress nice
- Record Yourself and watch it. (Ugh)
- Consider Public Speaking Meetup
- See [Speaking Hacks](http://www.speakinghacks.com/)
- See [Rehersal Tips](Rehersal.txt)

## Effective Visualization

- Types of Data
- Basic Charts
- Charts vs Graphics
- Telling a Story

### Types of Data

- Quantitative. Things you can measure (1 2 3)
- Ordered / Qualitative. Things that can be ordered (Low Med High)
- Categorical. Everything else (Fruit Vegetables)

See [Levels of Measurement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)

### Choosing a Graph
Choosing a graph depends on:
- Intended message (Comparison, Distribution, Correlation, Evolution)
- Type of Data 

### Telling a Story

1. Formulate the Question
2. Gather the data
3. Apply a visual representation

**Formulate the Question**
This can be an iterative process. You will learn how to ask a good question when you are familiar with the data.

**Apply a visual Representation**
See [TM&Th-4.0-summary.pdf](TM&Th-4.0-summary.pdf)
